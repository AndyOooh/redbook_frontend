## Prelude
This project is for showcasing my capabilities as a full stack web developer.

It is inspired by [Build Facebook clone with REACT JS AND THE MERN STACK 2022](https://www.udemy.com/course/build-facebook-clone-and-master-react-js-mern-stack-2022/). 

However, it differs in implementation (and sometomes choice) of technologies and techniques. 

## Description
This project is an imitation of Facebook without the full suite of features facebook has. Refer to [features](#features) for a list of implemented and planned features.

## Usage

   1. Create a user with your own or a [throw-away email](https://temp-mail.org/en/).
   2. Upload pofile- and cover images, update your bio and other details, create posts, comment, like, request/accept friendships.
